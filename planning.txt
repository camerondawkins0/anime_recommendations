Anime Recommendations Timeline/Requirements:

Synopsis:
"I am creating this recommendation model/application to aid with broadening one's
anime horizons. The application will take in a user's favorite anime(s) and return
recommendations based on the plot, genre, and characters within the anime(s). 

I have a difficult time finding new anime that fit my interests without getting
burnt out before I can even find a new one. So this will help me stay interested
as anime is past time of mine."
